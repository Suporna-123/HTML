            <h1>Cricket</h1>
            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between 
                two teams of <mark>eleven players</mark> on a field at 
                the centre of which is a <pre>22-yard pitch</pre> with a 
                wicket at each end, each compromising two bails balanced 
                on <code>three stumps</code>. The balling side scores 
                runs by stricking the ball bowled at the wicket with the 
                bat, while the <abbr>bowling and fielding</abbr> side 
                tries to prevent this and <blockquote>dismiss</blockquote> 
                each batter.
